# Classes
The source code of the backend for the ["Classes" project](https://github.com/richardyi25/richardyi25.github.io/tree/master/classes).

## What is this?

This code requests data from a Google Sheet, which is the data from a Google Form asking what classes people have. Then it parses it to JavaScript.

I'm putting the code here pretty much as a backup and so that I have some practice in Git.
